English and American sailors circa 1700 – 1750 used ink or gunpowder to create tattoos by pricking the skin and rubbing the powder into the wound. Following the American Revolution, American sailors' tattoos were listed in their protection papers, an identity certificate issued to prevent impressment into the British Royal Navy. </p>

The development of electric  tattoo machines in the 1890s enabled faster and more precise tattooing. To fulfill increased demand for tattoos, artists began to buy and sell sets of pre-drawn designs, especially simple designs with black outlines and limited colors, to enable quick work </p>

Sailors continued to use tattoos for identification in World War II: Social Security number or service number tattoos were available for $1.50. A specific style of “old-school” tattoos became popular among sailors in the 1930s–1940s, featuring traditional symbols and other maritime-inspired images inked in simple black lines with color touches. </p>

Sailors with visible tattoos became eligible for recruiting duty and training recruits at boot camp. </p>
